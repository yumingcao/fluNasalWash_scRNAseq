# scRNA-seq data on influenza infected human nasal wash samples 
This repository contains scripts for the study on influenza virus infected human nasal wash samples using scRNA-seq: 
>Cao Y*, Guo Z*, Vangala P, Donnard E, Liu P, McDonel P, Ordovas-Montanes J, Finberg RW, Wang JW#, and Garber M# “Single cell analysis of upper airway cells reveals host and viral dynamics in influenza-infected adults.” bioRxiv.  

The analysis highlights the algorithm ***scVirusFinder*** in defining infected cells in scRNA-seq data given ambient RNA contamination.  
Scripts for ***index swapping*** and ***cell barcode collision*** for Seq-Well data sequenced on NovaSeq platform.
